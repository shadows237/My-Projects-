        life and set the foundation for your future. By choosing to create a future for yourself from our

    <hr>
    <p>Being the Founder Director of MCC &amp; Secretary of Moraine Human Resource Development Organization,
        my vision is to develop a model institution of Applied Science, Humanities, Social Science and
        Education, and Research Centre with job-oriented courses for the students coming from different
        parts of India and abroad.<br>
        <br>
        In the competitive world of today, survival is not just a matter of qualifications but one of
        qualifications with competence. A better survivor is one with better competency and
        qualifications. The thrust is a specialization creating a newer one by one's ability, skill,
        qualification and competency. There are so many institutions in our country. All of them
        strive to add some value in an individual's life. "Midnapore City College (MCC)" has been
        initiated with the vision of enabling the youth of this country to have a purposeful vision,
        mission and goal. I always think the betterment of the Institution and to shape the
        Institute as a Centre of Excellence for higher studies and researches in science, Humanities,
        Social Science and Education, particularly in emerging areas.<br>
        <br>
        The basic objective of the institute is to organize undergraduate courses of study in
        Science, Humanities, Social Science and Education. But I have the plan to extend and
        incorporate other fields of studies in the institute, so that the passed-out students
        of MCC, after completion of UG degree, can avail of Post Graduate studies under same
        roof.<br>
        <br>
        As a Director of this College, I can assure you that the college will provide all
        the assistance to you for pursuing your goals. It is with this purpose that the
        college has initiated measures not just to encourage students to pursue their
        education purposefully but also to provide additional competency through educating
        them in the respective field.<br>
        <br>
        I hope the students who step into this institution would use the facilities available
        and attain their goals.<br><br>

        <br>
        Wish you all the best.
